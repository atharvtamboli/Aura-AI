# Aura-AI
This project is a smart mood-tracking system that allows users to monitor their mental health through daily check-ins, journaling, and advanced AI-powered facial recognition. Unlike traditional trackers that rely only on self-reports, this system analyzes facial expressions, voice tone, and text sentiment to detect real-time emotional states.

The platform then provides personalized insights, visual mood patterns, and mental wellness recommendations, helping individuals build self-awareness, manage stress, and improve overall emotional well-being.
