# Aura-AI
This project is a smart mood-tracking system that allows users to monitor their mental health through daily check-ins, journaling, and advanced AI-powered facial recognition. Unlike traditional trackers that rely only on self-reports, this system analyzes facial expressions, voice tone, and text sentiment to detect real-time emotional states.
